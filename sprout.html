                <h2>The Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        The brief I received from Career Foundry asked me to design a mobile-first, responsive web application that allows users to connect with an expert. 
                    </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                    <p>
                        The project spanned eight months during my UX Immersion course. I handled all of the UX design, UI design and user research independently while also working hard to complete my studies in Swedish as a Second Language. This meant I had to apply my strong time management skills to plan head for tasks such as user interviews and Figma training while also keeping up with my studies.
                    </p>
                <h3>My Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        My goal as a UX designer was to design a solution to help gardeners find local expert help, which would have a positive impact on the environment and people who garden outdoors.  
                    </p>  
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="process">

                <h2>My Process</h2>
                <div class="process-wrapper">
                    <p>
                        I began by creating a timeline to help me stay on track and planned ahead when I would need to meet with potential users. I followed the double-diamond process but sometimes had to repeat steps such as ideation and testing, so my process was very non-linear. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="process-wrapper">
                    <h3>Discovery</h3>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="column">
                            <p>
                                First, I prepared questions and conducted three interviews with gardeners in Stockholm and Ireland to find out why and in what context they use gardening apps.
                            </p>
                            <a href="files/inspiration.pdf" target="_blank">

                            <p>
                                Gardners' problems range from confusion over local pesticide regulations, local logistical concerns, local irrigation lawsâ€¦ as well as simple plant identification. This meant they needed expert knowledge from someone in their area, along with a simple tool to help them identify potential problematic plants and insects. 
                            </p>

                        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                            <p>
                                I wondered: <em>Isn't the world already over-saturated with plant identification apps?</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most important takeaway from my problem-space research was that gardeners need something more than just plant identification. My solution would stand out from the typical plant care/plant i.d. apps on the market. It would allow gardeners to get in touch with a local expert who could offer quick and affordable advice, all while in the comfort of their own gardens.
                            </p>

                                After getting an understanding of the gardeners' problems, I could then try to put myself in their shoes to come up with a solution. I created two user personas that would keep me focused on who I would be designing for.

                                Both of my user personas were based on real people, so I wanted to be sure to design features that would help them get local expert help, build a gardener community, and get quick and easy plant care tips on the go.

                                First and foremost, I made sure to include a diverse group of gardeners in my research and test groups. By including people of different genders, ages, religions, ethnicities, etc. this would <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/trina-moore-pervall/" target="_blank">eliminate any unconscious bias</a> on my part.

                                As a UX designer it was also my responsibility to ensure people with disabilities were able to use Sprout on the web, so I updated the UI's colours, fonts and backgrounds to comply with WCAG. I also added a voice feature in the search bar and floating labels in input fields. This would help make the product accessible to everyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also considered emotional design, which drove the colours, illustrations and images I chose--all of which gave a sense of friendliness, warmth and trust.

                                At last! Sprout was ready to come to life. All high-fidelity wireframes were made into an interactive prototype, giving potential users (gardeners, of course!) an understanding of the basic look and feel of Sprout, which would be used right away in my first round of usability testing.

                                I recruited six gardeners to participate in usability testing. The results showed usability issues at three levels:

                                    At UI level, gardeners were confused by unfamiliar icons which slowed them down when booking an expert.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    At screen level, irrelevant information, inconsistency in the design and unexpected placement of icons made the expers profile screen difficult to navigate.

                                    At flow level, the Booking an Expert flow was complicated and cognitively demanding (see below). This slowed down the booking process.

                        Once all iterations were complete, I reflected on the entire design process, including what I learned and the challenges I faced along the way.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the project I faced these dilemmas and constraints: 
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Time! Although the bootcamp offered flexibility in choosing which days to turn in my deliverables, there was still a timeline to follow and weekly deadlines to meet in order to complete the project on time. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On the expert feed's filter, each gardener had a different opinion about the most essential filter criteria. This made it difficult to please everyone.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gardeners asked for extra features, such as a to-do list, which I designed but later removed when I re-considered users' primary goal.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="conclusion-wrapper">
                <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Just because users ask for something doesn't mean they need it or that it will help them achieve their primary goal. When a designer focuses on the users' primary goal, it becomes easier to pinpoint and let go of the irrelevant. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The importance of user-centered design. When users' thoughts and feelings about a product are considered in the design process, it ultimately makes the product much more engaging, useful and viable.
